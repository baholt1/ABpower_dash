## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

url <- 'http://ets.aeso.ca/ets_web/ip/Market/Reports/CSDReportServlet'

html <- rvest::read_html(url)

df <- html %>% rvest::html_elements(css = "table") %>% 
   .[[20]] %>% rvest::html_table()




```
